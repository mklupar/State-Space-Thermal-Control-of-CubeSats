# State-Space-Thermal-Control-for-CubeSats

Please use CITATION.ccf if any of my work is used. My thesis will be available at the University of Arizona archive staring May 2025.
## CubeSat Thermal Modeling and State Space Thermal Control Code
Contains code for 1 and 8 node thermal modeling. Equations for each case are converted into state space form. With this form a control input (Heater input in Watts) is found to control each node of the payload to a desired temperature to minimize thermal gradients.
