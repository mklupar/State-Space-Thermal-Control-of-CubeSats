# State-Space-Thermal-Control-for-CubeSats
## CubeSat Thermal Modeling and State Space Thermal Control Code
Contains code for 1 and 8 node thermal modeling. Equations for each case are converted into state space form. With this form a control input (Heater input in Watts) is found to control each node of the payload to a desired temperature.
